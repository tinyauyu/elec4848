ELEC4848 - Data Encryption on Computational-contrained Device
=============================================================

This is the workspace for the Senior Design Project (ELEC4848).

"Data security is becoming more and more important. However, some data encryption algorithms are expensive, and may not be suitable to be sued in computationally-contrained devices. The objective of this project is to study the tradeoff between security, computational complexity, space complexity, energy etc.
Student taking this project are required to implement various data encryption algorithms on a small network built on Raspberry Pis."
